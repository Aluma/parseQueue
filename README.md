#Introduction

Today we are going to be building a queue app similar to the one we use during class. Instead of a Firebase backend though, we will be using Parse. 

Parse is good because it encourages us to create a RESTful API. We will learn how to make the 4 HTTP requests with AgularJS:

<ul>
	<li>GET</li>
	<li>POST</li>
	<li>PUT</li>
	<li>DELETE</li>
</ul>
